#TypeScript

---

Hopefully on my way towards mastering TypeScript.

The JS code attached should hopefully provide a good starting point for this *road*. I will tackle the Js problem that 
would arise by the concation of the two numbers after trying to add them together. I have installed typescript through 
**npm** with the following command in the terminal **npm install -g typescrip@latest**.

1. deleted original js file and created a ts-only.js and copied over the js code for alterations
2. ensured that input one and input 2 where recordnised and yielding values 
3. added types to the parameters of of add `: number`
4. the values recieved in the eventlistener will yield strings of *+* will convert the strings to numbers
5. urika seems all good seems good
