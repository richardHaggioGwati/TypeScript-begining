Hopefully on my way towards mastering TypeScript.

The JS code attached should hopefully provide a good starting point for this *road*. I will tackle the Js problem that 
would arise by the concation of the two numbers after trying to add them together. I have installed typescript through 
**npm** with the following command in the terminal **npm install -g typescrip@latest**.
